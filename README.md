Spring-1

Spring Algorithm include different kind of reverse first we need to reverse two bit 00 to 11 or 11 to 00 other left the same; next two bits need to reverse 00 to 10 or 10 to 00 other left the same; next two bits need to reverse 10 to 11 or 11 to 10 other left the same and next two bits reverse the same like two bits before 4:6. After this reverse need to use paq compression. To use paq we need to pip install cython and pip install paq.
